                        <p>Being a tactician by nature, I have a tendency to assess all possible outcomes in order to make the most concise and effective decision. Having this aspiration, I am drawn to studying strategic management due to the overarching desire to serve and help others make the most out of their efforts. Functioning as a guide, I plan to lead teams and companies to broaden their potential and adapt to a changing world.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Who am I</h2>
                        <p>My name is Timothy Gelatka from Southern California. In December of 2019, I graduated with four business associates degrees, and became the first of my family to graduate from college. At the time I figured this was enough. This mindset changed just before my mission.</p>
                        <p>Over the last few years, the reality of becoming an entrepreneur became imaginable. I’m excited to learn about how I can apply gospel principles to business. One of my ambitions is to create a nonprofit devoted to growing food in impoverished countries; another is to streamline the vacation and traveling process to include things like language and cultural learning. I am a passionate gardener, and even more passionate about efficiency and making people happy. I hope to become a better leader able to hire, inspire, and utilize employees to make these dreams a reality.</p>
                        <p>"The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow."</p>

                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                        <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p> -->
